# Fullkit

A collection of packages to create a Django-like experience with fullstack javascript.

## Get started

To install the server library enter the following command:

```
npm install @fullkit/server @fullkit/stem-renderer
```

You can also install only the packages you like for exemple `@fullkit/client` to use the reactivity functions inspired by Solidjs.

```
npm install @fullkit/client
```
